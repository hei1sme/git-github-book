Examples include Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.</li> <li>Pros: No single point of failure (every developer has a full backup), excellent offline capabilities (most operations are local), faster operations (history is local), better handling of branching and merging.</li> <li>Cons: Can be slightly more complex to grasp initially.</li> </ul> <p>Git is a Distributed Version Control System, and its distributed nature is a key reason for its power and popularity.</p>"},{"location":"02-chapter-01-introduction-to-git/#12-what-is-git","title":"1.2 What is Git?","text":"<p>Git is a free and open-source Distributed Version Control System designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, in 2005.</p> <p>Unlike older VCS that might think of storing data as a set of file-based changes (delta-based), Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots. Every time you commit changes, Git essentially takes a picture of all your files at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p> <p>If files haven't changed, Git doesn't store the file again; it just stores a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.

It contains the <code>.git</code> directory, which holds all the version control metadata.</li> <li>Commit: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It's the fundamental unit of work in Git. Each commit has a unique identifier (a hash), a message describing the changes, and references to the previous commits (its parents).</li> <li>Branch: A branch is essentially an independent line of development. When you create a branch, you're creating a pointer to a specific commit. As you make new commits on that branch, the branch pointer moves forward. Branches allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main project until their work is ready.</li> <li>Merge: The process of combining the changes from one branch into another.</li> <li>Remote: A remote repository is a version of your repository hosted on the internet or a network. GitHub is a popular hosting service for remote Git repositories. You interact with remotes to share your changes and get updates from others.</li> <li>Working Directory: This is the actual directory on your computer where your project files reside.</li> <li>Staging Area (Index): A crucial intermediate area in Git. Before you commit changes, you add them to the staging area using <code>git add</code>. This allows you to carefully select which changes (even within a single file) will be included in your next commit. It's like preparing a set of changes before packaging them up in a commit snapshot.</li> </ul> <p>[Insert Diagram: Git Workflow - Showing Working Directory, Staging Area, Local Repository, and Remote Repository]</p>"},{"location":"02-chapter-01-introduction-to-git/#13-what-is-github","title":"1.3 What is GitHub?","text":"<p>While Git is the tool for version control, GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and a suite of collaboration features built around Git.</p> <p>Think of Git as the engine and GitHub as the online garage, social network, and project management system for those engines.</p>"},{"location":"02-chapter-01-introduction-to-git/#131-github-as-a-platform","title":"1.3.1 GitHub as a Platform","text":"<p>Launched in 2008, GitHub has become the largest and most popular web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development.

Workflows can have multiple jobs, which can run sequentially or in parallel. Jobs are independent of each other by default, but you can define dependencies.</li> <li>Step: An individual task within a job. A step can be: </li> <li>Running a command-line script (e.g., <code>run: npm install</code>).</li> <li>Running an Action (reusable pieces of code shared on GitHub Marketplace).</li> <li>Action: A custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex task.

In a detached HEAD state, it points directly to a commit.</p> <p>Ignored Files (.gitignore): Files and directories that Git is configured to ignore and not track changes for, specified in a <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p> <p>Initialize (<code>git init</code>): A Git command to create a new, empty Git repository in the current directory.</p> <p>Issue: A feature on GitHub (and other platforms) used to track tasks, bugs, feature requests, or other items related to a project.</p> <p>Job: A set of steps in a GitHub Actions workflow that executes on a single runner.</p> <p>Lightweight Tag: A simple pointer to a commit in Git, without extra metadata like a message or tagger information.</p> <p>Main Branch: The conventional name for the primary development branch in a Git repository (formerly <code>master</code>). Often represents the stable or production-ready code.</p> <p>Markdown (.md): A lightweight markup language commonly used for README files, wiki pages, and comments on GitHub.</p> <p>Merge (<code>git merge</code>): The process of combining changes from one Git branch into another. Can result in a fast-forward merge or a three-way merge with a merge commit.</p> <p>Merge Conflict: See Conflict.</p> <p>Merge Commit: A commit created during a three-way merge that ties together the histories of the two branches being merged.</p> <p>Origin: The conventional name for the default remote repository that a local repository was cloned from or linked to.</p> <p>Private Repository: A repository visible only to the owner and explicitly added collaborators/teams.</p> <p>Public Repository: A repository visible to anyone on the internet.</p> <p>Pull (<code>git pull</code>): A Git command that is a combination of <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge</code>. It downloads changes from a remote repository and automatically integrates them into the current local branch.</p> <p>Pull Request (PR): A feature on GitHub (and similar platforms) used to propose changes made on a branch, facilitate code review, and integrate those changes into another branch (typically the base branch).</p> <p>Push (<code>git push</code>): A Git command to upload local commits and branch references to a remote repository.</p> <p>Rebase (<code>git rebase</code>): A Git command to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It rewrites commit history and creates a linear history.</p> <p>Reflog (<code>git reflog</code>): A local log that tracks updates to the tips of branches and other references in the repository. Useful for recovering lost commits.</p> <p>Remote: A reference to another copy of the repository, usually hosted on a server (like GitHub). Allows pushing and pulling changes.</p> <p>Repository (Repo): The central storage location for a project's files and the entire history of changes managed by Git. Contains the hidden <code>.git</code> directory.</p> <p>Revert (<code>git revert</code>): A Git command that creates a new commit to undo the changes introduced by a specific previous commit. Does not rewrite history, making it safe for shared branches.</p> <p>Rewriting History: Modifying past commits (e.g., using <code>git commit --amend</code>, <code>git rebase</code>, <code>git reset</code>). This changes commit hashes and should be avoided on branches that have been shared with others.</p> <p>Role: Permission level assigned to a collaborator or team on a GitHub repository (Read, Triage, Write, Maintain, Admin).</p> <p>Runner: The server environment where GitHub Actions workflow jobs execute (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).</p> <p>Secrets: Encrypted environment variables stored in GitHub repository or organization settings, used to securely provide sensitive information (like API keys) to GitHub Actions workflows.</p> <p>Snapshot: How Git fundamentally stores data. Each commit is a snapshot of all the files in the project at that moment.</p> <p>Squash and Merge: A Pull Request merge strategy on GitHub that combines all commits from the feature branch into a single new commit on the base branch.</p> <p>Staging Area (Index): An intermediate area in Git where you collect changes (using <code>git add</code>) before committing them. It represents the snapshot that will be included in the next commit.</p> <p>Status (<code>git status</code>): A Git command that shows the current state of the working directory and the staging area, indicating changes that are untracked, staged, or unstaged.</p> <p>Step: An individual task within a job in a GitHub Actions workflow. Can be a command-line script or an Action.</p> <p>Tag: A pointer in Git used to mark specific points in history as important, typically used for releases (e.g., v1.0).</p> <p>Three-Way Merge: A type of merge that occurs when histories have diverged. Git uses the two branch tips and their common ancestor to create a new merge commit.</p> <p>Tracking Branch (Remote-tracking branch): A reference in your local repository to the state of a branch on a remote repository (e.g., <code>origin/main</code>). Updated by <code>git fetch</code>.</p> <p>Untracked Files: New files in your working directory that Git sees but are not yet being tracked by the repository.</p> <p>Upstream: In a forking workflow, the original repository that was forked (in contrast to <code>origin</code>, which points to your fork).</p> <p>Version Control System (VCS): A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</p> <p>Webhook: An automated message sent from GitHub to a configured URL in response to events in the repository. Used for integrating with external services.</p> <p>Working Directory: The directory on your local file system that contains the project files you are currently working on.</p> <p>Workflow: A customizable automated process defined in a YAML file in <code>.github/workflows</code> that runs in response to events in a GitHub repository.</p>"},{"location":"13-appendix-b-commands-reference/","title":"Appendix B: Useful Git Commands Reference","text":""},{"location":"13-appendix-b-commands-reference/#appendix-b-useful-git-commands-reference","title":"Appendix B: Useful Git Commands Reference","text":"<p>This appendix provides a quick reference for the Git commands discussed in this textbook, categorized for easier lookup.</p> <p>Getting Started &amp; Configuration</p> <ul> <li>git --version Show the installed Git version.</li> <li>git config --global user.name \"Your Name\" Set the name to be attached to your commits globally.</li> <li>git config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\" Set the email to be attached to your commits globally.</li> <li>git config --global --list List all global Git configurations.</li> <li>git init Create a new, empty Git repository in the current directory.</li> <li>git clone  Download an existing repository, including its full history, and set up a remote named <code>origin</code>. <p>Basic Workflow: Status, Staging, Committing</p> <ul> <li>git status Show the status of the working directory and staging area (untracked, modified, staged files, current branch).</li> <li>git add  Add changes from the working directory to the staging area for a specific file. <li>git add .
